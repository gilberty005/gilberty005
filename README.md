## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at Columbia University. I'm currently interested in natural language processing and algorithmic machine learning. 

Currently, I'm working on two main projects. At the AlQuraishi Lab, I'm working on enhancing the interpretability of genomic language models. At Columbia's Business School, I'm starting work on data mixtures.
